Abstract
Background
Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a serious complication following cardiac surgery, associated with high morbidity and mortality. Most cardiac surgery patients have comorbid conditions commonly managed with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors. However, the effects of perioperative RAS inhibitors management on patient outcomes remain controversial.
Methods
This multicenter retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of perioperative RASi, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), on CSA-AKI within 48 hours after surgery. Adult patients (≥18 years) undergoing major open-heart surgery at five medical centers in China between January 2000 and December 2022, who had received chronic RAS inhibitors therapy for at least 3 months preoperatively, were included for analysis. Patients were classified as “Continuation” (RAS inhibitors continued through the day of surgery) or “Discontinuation” (held 24–48 hours preoperatively) group. CSA-AKI was defined and staged (KDIGO criteria: Stage I/II/III).The primary outcomes were AKI (overall and by stage); secondary outcomes included the occurrence of dialysis and mortality in hospital. We performed 1:1 propensity score matching to balance baseline characteristics. Subgroup interactions by preexisting chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and other risk factors were assessed.
Results
Between January 2000 and October 2024, a total of 54,896 patients underwent cardiac surgery across the five participating hospitals. After the exclusion, a total of 12,355 patients (65.6% male; 59.1±12.2 years) receiving chronic RAS inhibitors therapy underwent analysis. Among matched pairs, perioperative continuation of RAS inhibitors therapy was associated with a higher incidence of mild acute kidney injury ( 21.3% vs. 23.8%; RR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.83–0.96]; P=0.004), but significantly lower incidence of severe AKI (3.5% vs. 4.7%; RR = 1.25, [1.03-1.52]; P=0.024) and reduced in-hospital mortality (1.1% vs. 1.7%; RR = 1.53, [1.08–2.17]; P=0.018). Subgroup analyses indicated patients with hypertension (RR = 0.93, [0.88–0.99]), eGFR ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m²(RR = 0.84, [0.71–0.99]) experienced greater reductions in severe AKI risk with perioperative continuation, while patients with respiratory disease (RR = 1.96, [1.36–2.81]) or undergoing surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass (RR = 1.84, [1.23–2.76]) increased severe AKI risk.
Conclusions
Discontinuing RAS inhibitors before cardiac surgery was associated with a significant reduction in severe AKI and in-hospital mortality but an increased incidence of mild AKI. These benefits varied by patient subgroup, with greater protection in hypertension or severe renal impairment, but increased risk in respiratory disease or off-pump surgery, which supporting personalized perioperative management strategies.

Introduction
Annually, over two million patients worldwide undergo cardiac surgery for valvular heart disease or congenital heart defects1, 2. Despite reduced procedural mortality, cardiac surgery still frequently leads to postoperative complications, notably the surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) rate, with an incidence range from 8.9% to 39% 3, 4. Severe CSA-AKI significantly increases mortality risk by 2-6 times, and even within-hospital renal recovery, CSA-AKI is significantly independently associated with their 10-year mortality risk3.
Patients undergoing cardiac surgery frequently have comorbid conditions managed with long-term renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which are prescribed for hypertension, chronic kidney disease(CKD), and heart failure5, 6. Chronic RAS inhibitors therapy has established renal and cardiovascular benefits, reducing intraglomerular hypertension, proteinuria, fibrosis, inflammation, and improving cardiac remodeling.5, 6. Paradoxically, these same pharmacologic actions can present acute risks during the perioperative period7. By blocking angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, RAS inhibitors therapy may impair renal autoregulation and precipitate intraoperative hypotension, potentially reducing renal perfusion and increasing the risk of CSA-AKI8. However, evidence for the efficacy of perioperative RAS inhibitors treatment in reducing adverse perioperative outcomes remains inconclusive, with most current data derived from studies in non-cardiac procedures, with limited data in cardiac surgical procedures, primarily consisting of small randomized control trails (RCTs) and cohort studies9, 10.
Current clinical guidelines reflect this uncertainty. The 2014 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) guidelines recommend discontinuing ACEIs 24–48 hours prior to surgery to minimize perioperative complications11. However, the updated 2024 ESC/EACTS guidelines advocate an individualized approach based on patient-specific factors (Class IIa, Level B)12. Similarly, guidelines from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) on coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) acknowledge uncertainty regarding the safety of continuing preoperative RAS inhibitors in patients on chronic therapy13. This lack of consensus arises from conflicting evidence in the literature. Previous landmark studies have produced contradictory findings.14-17 For example, Drenger et al. (2012) 15 associated continued RAS inhibitors therapy with improved postoperative outcomes following CABG, whereas Miceli et al. (2009) 14. reported a twofold increase in AKI and mortality risk associated with preoperative ACEI use. Recent meta-analyses further highlight these inconsistencies: one reported no significant overall association between perioperative RAS inhibitors use and AKI, although substantial heterogeneity and potential residual confounding were noted18. In contrast, Bandeali et al.’s CABG-specific study suggested an increased risk of AKI19.
Differences in patient characteristics, timing of drug administration, and AKI definitions might contribute to these discrepancies. Previous studies often treated AKI as a binary outcome, failing to adequately differentiate between mild, transient AKI and severe AKI. This oversimplification could mask clinically relevant differences in the impact of perioperative RAS inhibitors. Secondly, precise definitions of perioperative medication discontinuation timing have been lacking. Additionally, comprehensive subgroup analyses identifying populations that benefit most from RAS inhibitors continuation are lacking, which limits individualized clinical decision-making. To address these critical gaps, we conducted a large-scale, multicenter cohort study, explicitly stratifying CSA-AKI severity by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes(KDIGO) criteria and defining perioperative RAS inhibitors continuation through surgery day versus discontinuation 24 - 48 hours preoperatively. We hypothesized that continuation of RAS inhibitors therapy would reduce the incidence of severe CSA-AKI and improve clinical outcomes, with potential variability across patient subgroups. Our study aims to provide robust evidence supporting individualized perioperative decision-making for RAS inhibitors management.


Methods
Study Design and Participants
We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study at five academic medical centers in China (the First, Third, Sixth, and Seventh Medical Centers of Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing, and Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital). The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Chinese PLA General Hospital (S2021-305-01) and Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (S2020-281-01), with waiver of informed consent due to the retrospective nature of the study. We identified all adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who underwent cardiac surgery between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2022, and had received long-term therapy with RAS inhibitors for at least 3 months before surgery. Eligible procedures included CABG, valve repair or replacement, combined valve and coronary procedures, aortic surgery, and pericardiectomy. We excluded patients who underwent emergency surgery, robotic procedures, or thoracic aortic operations; those without baseline or postoperative serum creatinine measurements; those with missing operative records. Patients with very short (<1 day) preoperative hospitalizations or excessively long postoperative stays (>3 months) were excluded due to potential atypical clinical trajectories that could bias outcomes. For patients with multiple cardiac surgery admissions, only the first admission was included in the analysis.
Data Collection
Data were extracted from electronic medical records, including demographics, comorbidities identified through International Classification of Diseases, ICD, 9th and 10th Revision codes, laboratory results, medications, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes. Pre- and postoperative medication orders for RAS inhibitors were identified through electronic medical records and pharmacy charge codes, which capture each administered medication and its precise timing. Prior outpatient use of RAS inhibitors was verified via the shared military healthcare system records and admission medication histories. To ensure data accuracy and reliability, all extracted electronic records were cross-validated through random audits by trained research personnel at each center. Any discrepancies were resolved through consensus. We excluded patients with missing categorical variables and used predictive mean matching to impute missing continuous variables (mice package, 50 iterations). Body-mass index was calculated from height and weight, with implausible values (≤0 or >100 kg/m²) treated as missing before imputation.
Treatment Strategy Definitions
Patients were categorized into two exposure groups for analysis based on perioperative RAS inhibitor use: a continuation group (patients who continued their RAS inhibitors therapy through the day of surgery, and a discontinuation group (patients whose RAS inhibitors therapy was held or stopped in the 24–48 hours prior to surgery). The specific RAS inhibitors compounds included in each category are listed in Table S1.
Outcomes and Covariates
The primary endpoints for this analysis were defined according to modified KDIGO criteria, based on changes in serum creatinine. In addition, considering patients undergoing cardiac surgery often experience dynamic fluid balance adjustments through volume expansion and diuretics, rendering urine output an unreliable indicator in this context20-23; we further complemented by clinician-diagnosed AKI via ICD codes. Specifically, Stage I (mild AKI) was defined as an increase in creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dL or 1.5–1.9× baseline. Stage II (moderate AKI) was defined as a creatinine increase 2.0–2.9× baseline. Stage III (severe AKI) was defined as a creatinine increase ≥3× baseline, or to ≥4.0 mg/dL, or initiation of dialysis. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of dialysis and all-cause mortality in hospital.
Key preoperative covariates included demographics (age, sex, body mass index), baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated by CKD-EPI equation from outpatient creatinine), baseline preoperative creatinine, medical history (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, respiratory disease, baseline kidney dysfunction, identified by ICD codes), and medications use (β-blockers, statins, or antiplatelet agents). Surgical covariates included the type of procedure (isolated CABG, isolated valve surgery, combined CABG and valve, or other complex cardiac surgeries), use of cardiopulmonary bypass, and use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), total surgical duration, and intraoperative bleeding volume. These variables were selected a priori for adjustment due to their potential association with both the likelihood of RAS inhibitors continuation and the risk of AKI or mortality.
Statistical Analysis
To address potential confounding by indication, we applied propensity score matching to compare outcomes between RAS inhibitors continuation and discontinuation groups. Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression models incorporating the covariates detailed above. Patients were matched in a 1:1 ratio using nearest-neighbor matching without replacement and a caliper width of 0.1 standard deviations of the logit-transformed propensity score. Covariate balance between matched groups was evaluated using standardized mean differences, with values below 0.1 considered indicative of adequate balance. In the matched cohort, risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using bootstrap resampling with 1,000 replications.
Incidence rates for each outcome (AKI stages I-III, dialysis initiation, and mortality) were compared between the discontinuation and continuation groups within the propensity score-matched cohort. RRs and RDs (per 1,000 patients) with 95% CIs were derived via bootstrap resampling (1,000 replications). Additionally, odds ratios (ORs) for these outcomes were estimated using logistic regression models in the matched cohort.
Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted to assess potential effect modification by key patient characteristics, including age (<65 vs ≥65 years), eGFR (≤30 vs 30-60 vs ≥60mL/min/1.73 m²) sex, baseline chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, surgery type (coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery, or other), and cardiopulmonary bypass use. Within each subgroup, separate propensity score matching was performed, and heterogeneity was evaluated through interaction terms in regression models, with statistical significance for interactions defined as P < 0.05.
Several sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of our findings. First, inverse probability of treatment weighting(IPTW) based on propensity scores was applied to the full cohort, with post-weighting balance assessed using standardized mean differences. Second, we repeated the primary propensity score matching analysis using a range of caliper widths to assess the impact of different matching parameters on effect estimates and covariate balance. Third, competing risk analyses were conducted for AKI outcomes, treating death as a competing event.
Continuous variables were summarized as means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges, as appropriate based on distribution. Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages. Between-group comparisons used Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables (depending on normality) and the chi-square test for categorical variables. All analyses were performed using R version 4.3.2, with key packages including ‘MatchIt’ for matching, cobalt for balance assessment, mediation and mice for supplementary analyses, and ggplot2 for visualization. Tests were two-sided, and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Study Population
Between January 2000 and October 2024, a total of 54,896 patients underwent cardiac surgery across the five participating hospitals. Among these, 12,355 patients met inclusion criteria by receiving chronic RAS inhibitors therapy preoperatively. As Table 1 shows that, of this RAS inhibitors therapy cohort 6,084 patients discontinued RAS inhibitors therapy in the 24–48 hours before surgery, with the mean age was 59.50 years, and 67.6% (4,113/6,084) were male. Whereas 6,271 patients continued RAS inhibitors through the perioperative period, with the mean age was 58.25 years, and 63.7% (3,992/6,271) were male. The proportions of missing data across the dataset were minimal (0.04%) for most variables, except for variable preoperative blood urea nitrogen (21.04% missing). The Table1 presents the participants’ baseline characteristics before and after propensity score matching. Before propensity adjustment, patients who continued RAS inhibitors therapy were more likely to have comorbid hypertension, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, and more often received concomitant medications such as statins, antiplatelet agents, calcium-channel blockers, and β-blockers. Continuation-group patients were also more likely to undergo CABG surgery and valve surgery, whereas discontinuation was more common in congenital heart surgery patients. After matching, 4,692 patients from each group were matched. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the matched continuation and discontinuation groups, with all covariates standardized mean differences <0.1 (Table 1). Figure S1 illustrates the covariate balance before and after matching, while Figure S2 shows the propensity score overlap between groups after matching. This matched cohort was used for all subsequent comparative analyses. The mean age of patients was 59.77 (Standard Deviation: ± 12.81) years in the discontinuation group and 59.52 (± 13.33) years in the continuation group. The patients' comorbidities were well balanced (for example, heart failure 41.5% vs 43.1%). Procedural characteristics, including the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and types of surgery, were similar in both groups. Use of concomitant medications such as statins, antiplatelet agents, calcium-channel blockers, and β-blockers was also comparable between the matched groups. 
RAS inhibitors Discontinuation vs Continuation: AKI and Mortality
As shown in Table 2, in the unmatched cohort the overall incidence of AKI (any stage) was 30.4% (1,905/6,271) in the RAS inhibitors discontinuation group vs 30.0% (1,828/6,084) in the continuation group (RR=1.01 [95% CI 0.96–1.07]; RD = 3.3 per 1000; P=0.688), indicating no significant difference in crude AKI risk. Before matching, the discontinuation group did exhibit a slightly higher incidence of severe AKI (Stage III) compared to the continuation group (4.4% vs 3.6%; RR=1.23 [1.03–1.46]; RD=8.2; P =0.02) . After propensity matching, the association patterns changed. The discontinuation group had a slightly lower incidence of any AKI compared to the continuation group in the matched analysis (30.7% vs 32.7%; RR = 0.94 [0.89–1.00]; RD = –19.6; P = 0.041), although this difference was of borderline statistical significance. 
When stratified by AKI severity, divergent patterns emerged. Mild AKI (Stage I) occurred in 22.2% (1,349/6,271) of the discontinuation group vs 21.1% (1,326/6,084) of the continuation group. In adjusted analysis, RAS inhibitors discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower risk of mild AKI (adjusted RR = 0.89 [0.83–0.96]; RD = –25.1; P =0.004) compared to continuing therapy. Moderate AKI (Stage II) incidence did not differ significantly between groups after matching (adjusted RR = 0.97 [0.83–1.14]; P = 0.726). For severe AKI (Stage III), 3.6% (218/6,217) of patients in the discontinuation group developed stage III AKI vs 4.4% (276/6,084) in the continuation group. After matching, RAS inhibitors discontinuation was associated with a higher risk of severe AKI (RR= 1.25 [1.03–1.52]; RD = +9.4; P =0.023). The need for acute dialysis (RRT) was relatively low in both groups (approximately 0.8% overall) and did not differ significantly between discontinuation vs continuation.
In-hospital mortality in the unmatched cohort was 1.6% (98/6,084) in the discontinuation group vs 1.2% (76/6,271) in the continuation group (RR, 1.25 [0.93–1.68]; P = 0.14). After propensity matching, the mortality difference became significant: the discontinuation group had a higher all-cause mortality rate of 1.7% (78/4,715) vs 1.1% (51/4,715) in the continuation group (RR = 1.53 [1.08–2.17]; RD = +5.8; P = 0.018). 
Subgroup Analysis
The effect of perioperative RAS inhibitors discontinuation on AKI outcomes varied significantly across patient subgroups (Table S2; Figures 2-3, S3–S9). For overall AKI, significant interactions were noted for respiratory disease (P=0.013) and hypertension (P=0.035; Table S2). Patients without respiratory disease experienced reduced AKI risk with discontinuation (RR = 0.90 [0.84–0.97]), whereas those with respiratory disease derived no benefit (RR = 1.08 [0.96–1.22]). Similarly, patients without hypertension showed increased AKI risk (RR = 1.43 [0.95–2.14]), while hypertensive patients benefitted from discontinuation (RR = 0.93 [0.88–0.99]).
Stage-specific analyses stratified by renal function revealed nuanced patterns. For mild AKI (stage 1), significant interaction by eGFR was observed (P=0.026; Figure 2): discontinuation reduced risk among patients with preserved renal function (eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73m²; RR = 0.88 [0.81–0.96]), showed a trend toward benefit with moderate impairment (eGFR 30–60; RR = 0.91 [0.79–1.04]), but increased risk in severe impairment (eGFR <30; RR = 1.76 [0.95–3.26]). For severe AKI (stage 3), the pattern reversed significantly (P=0.003; Figure 3): severe renal impairment patients benefitted from discontinuation (RR = 0.84 [0.71–0.99]), while those with preserved function had increased risk (RR 1.50, [1.10–2.05]). Additional significant interactions included respiratory disease (P=0.003), with increased risk among patients with chronic lung disease (RR = 1.96 [1.36–2.81]), and cardiopulmonary bypass use (P=0.032), where discontinuation was associated with greater risk among non-bypass patients (RR = 1.84 [1.23–2.76]).
No significant heterogeneity was identified by age, sex, diabetes, heart failure although trends suggested potential effect modification. Collectively, these findings highlight baseline renal function and respiratory comorbidities as critical modifiers of the complex, stage-dependent effects of perioperative RAS inhibitors management.
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our findings across various analytical methods (Table S3). Relative risk estimates were stable across different caliper widths (0.05–0.30 SD of the logit propensity score). For total AKI, relative risks indicated a modest, non-significant protective effect of discontinuation (RR 0.95–0.98; Figure S10). Discontinuation significantly reduced mild AKI (stage 1) risk (RR 0.87–0.92; all p<0.05; Figure S11), but increased severe AKI (stage 3) risk (RR 1.28–1.38; all p<0.05; Figure S13). Mortality risks associated with discontinuation approached significance (RR 1.31–1.42; Figure S14). IPTW analysis yielded similar results, reinforcing these findings. The E-value analysis suggested minimal susceptibility to unmeasured confounding (E-value=4.6), and competing-risk analyses confirmed effect stability. Collectively, these analyses reinforce a consistent, stage-dependent association between perioperative RAS inhibitor discontinuation and postoperative AKI outcomes.
Discussion
In this multicenter cohort study of cardiac surgery patients on chronic RAS inhibitors therapy, perioperative continuation was associated with a higher incidence of mild AKI (KDIGO Stage I) but lower risks of severe AKI (Stage III), and in-hospital mortality compared to discontinuation. Subanalyses revealed treatment effects varied notably across patient subgroups; patients with hypertension or particularly those with severely impaired renal function (eGFR ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m²), gained greater benefit from continued therapy, while patients with respiratory disease or undergoing surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) showed increased risks. 
The paradoxical observation—an increased risk of mild AKI but a lower risk of severe AKI with continued RASi—can be explained by the unique hemodynamic effects of these drugs during surgical stress24. By inhibiting angiotensin II, RAS inhibitors dilate efferent arterioles, reduce intraglomerular pressure, and blunt compensatory vasoconstriction during periods of intraoperative hypotension25. This effect may transiently reduce glomerular filtration rate, manifesting as mild, typically reversible AKI, as evidenced in trials such as SOLVD and CONSENSUS, where transient creatinine elevations were not associated with adverse long-term outcomes26, 27. Conversely, the protective effect against severe AKI likely arises from reduced ischemia-reperfusion injury, anti-inflammatory properties, and improved endothelial function, which collectively prevent progression from mild injury to overt renal failure.
These nuanced effects help reconcile why previous studies on perioperative RAS inhibitors use have reported conflicting results. Earlier investigations were often limited by small sample sizes, single-center designs, or inconsistent methodologies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions28. Definitions of AKI varied widely across studies, and many analyses treated AKI as a binary outcome (present vs. absent) without accounting for severity, potentially masking the distinction between transient creatinine elevations and serious renal injury18. The timing of RAS inhibitors discontinuation was also inconsistently reported, complicating results interpretation. Moreover, prior research predominantly focused on patients undergoing CABG or valvular surgery, with limited data available for other cardiac surgical populations, and in most of studies, AKI was not a primary endpoint15, 18. Such methodological variations have made direct comparisons challenging and likely contributed to the mixed findings in the literature. 
A meta-analysis by Yacoub et al. of observational studies reported that preoperative RAS inhibitors use was associated with increased risks of AKI (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01–1.36) and mortality (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06–1.35), with substantial heterogeneity (I² =82.5%) to attributed inconsistent AKI definitions and study designs17. Ling et al. similarly highlighted insufficient evidence to support routine perioperative RAS inhibitor use29. More recently, a pooled analysis of 23 studies reported no significant relationship between RAS inhibitor use and postoperative AKI, again noting considerable methodological variability18. Similarly, several observational studies have reported conflicting findings. Drenger et al. (2012)15found that continued RAS inhibitor therapy was associated with improved postoperative outcomes following CABG, linking preoperative RAS inhibitors use to a 17% lower risk of postoperative AKI requiring dialysis (adjusted RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71–0.98). Conversely, a recent propensity-matched study of 317 CABG patients published in 2025 reported that chronic preoperative RAS inhibitor use significantly increased postoperative AKI risk, though the authors noted limited reliability of these findings due to the small sample size28.
On the other hand, we found that RAS inhibitors continuation was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality, consistent with previous studies reporting survival benefits in cardiac surgery. For instance, Qian et al observed significantly reduced 30-day mortality (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54–0.90), stroke, and renal failure with continued RAS inhibitor therapy30. Additionally, a U.S. Veterans cohort study reported that the early initiation or continuation of RASi post-AKI was associated with reduction in long-term mortality. Our findings extend these observations by suggesting a mechanism: the survival benefit of RAS inhibitors may be partly mediated through renal protection–i.e., by preventing severe AKI, which is itself a strong risk factor for mortality.
Subgroup analyses revealed significant heterogeneity in the treatment effects of perioperative RAS inhibitors continuation. Patients with an eGFR ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m² derived greater benefits, likely due to sustained renal perfusion. CKD is widely recognized as the most important risk factor for AKI. Prior studies, such as Shah M et al., reported that CKD status significantly modified the relationship between RAS inhibitors and AKI, but the authors acknowledged limitations in their data, including the inability to adequately stratify CKD by eGFR categories due to insufficient database information31. Our study addressed this issue, clearly demonstrating that patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m²) benefit most from continued RAS inhibitor therapy, potentially reducing progression to severe AKI. Conversely, patients with respiratory disease or those undergoing non-cardiopulmonary bypass surgery faced an increased risk of severe AKI, possibly due to hypotension exacerbating pulmonary-renal axis dysfunction, consistent with Arora et al.'s findings of elevated AKI rates among COPD patients32. These findings underscore the importance of personalized perioperative management strategies.
Our findings carry important clinical implications. By using standardized KDIGO criteria to stratify AKI severity our study helps reconcile previously conflicting findings. We demonstrate that while continuation of RAS inhibitors increases the incidence of mild, transient AKI, it yields significant clinical benefits by reducing severe AKI and mortality, clarifying earlier inconsistencies. Future research should further incorporate AKI severity stratification and biomarkers such as NGAL to differentiate transient creatinine elevations from structural kidney injury, enhancing precision in perioperative management. Additionally, our findings advocate for personalized perioperative management of RAS inhibitors rather than a universal approach. Decisions should be individualized based on patients' risk profiles and anticipated hemodynamic stability. Patients with strong clinical indications for RAS inhibitors, such as chronic kidney disease, or refractory hypertension who exhibit stable perioperative hemodynamics, are likely to benefit from continued therapy30, 33. In these cases, tolerating mild functional AKI could be justified by the reduced risk of severe AKI and major cardiac events. Current practice guidelines reflect this nuanced perspective, with European cardiac surgery guidelines generally recommending withholding ACEIs 24–48 hours before surgery, while heart failure guidelines emphasize continued use in high-risk patients11, 12, 34. Our study refines these recommendations by proposing a structured, individualized strategy that stratifies patients based on cardiac and renal risks, optimizing protective benefits while minimizing risks. This tailored approach aligns closely with precision medicine principles and represents a significant advance over existing perioperative management practices.
Our study has notable strengths. First, it represents the largest multicenter cohort to explicitly evaluate the clinical effects of perioperative continuation versus precisely timed short-term discontinuation of RAS inhibitors in cardiac surgery. The extensive study period spanning over two decades, inclusion of diverse surgical procedures, and broad patient demographics provide a robust dataset that greatly enhances the generalizability of our findings. Second, rigorous statistical methods, including propensity score matching and comprehensive sensitivity analyses, effectively mitigate potential confounding biases, ensuring robust conclusions. Third, stratifying AKI severity using standardized KDIGO criteria provides novel insights into the differential effects of RAS inhibitors on mild versus severe AKI, helping to reconcile previously conflicting results. Finally, detailed subgroup analyses identify specific patient populations—particularly those with chronic kidney disease or hypertension—who benefit most from perioperative continuation of RAS inhibitors. These findings directly inform personalized clinical decision-making, potentially improving perioperative patient management and outcomes.
Several limitations should also be acknowledged. First, given the observational and retrospective nature of our study, we report associations rather than causal relationships. Despite rigorous propensity matching, residual confounding from unmeasured variables, such as clinician judgment and intraoperative hemodynamic management, may still influence outcomes. Second, the long study duration (2000–2022) encompasses advances in surgical techniques, perfusion technology, and perioperative care standards. Although we adjusted for the surgical era and baseline outcome rates remained relatively stable, temporal trends could still influence our results. Third, our cohort was derived from a predominantly Chinese (Asian) patient population; racial or genetic factors affecting RAAS activity or AKI susceptibility were not assessed, limiting direct generalizability to other populations. Finally, we focused solely on in-hospital outcomes without assessing long-term renal function or survival following discharge. Whether perioperative management of RAS inhibitors impacts long-term outcomes, such as CKD progression or late mortality, remains unclear, though prior evidence suggests potential benefits from early postoperative resumption of ACEIs after AKI. Prospective trials with extended follow-up are necessary to validate and expand our conclusions.
Conclusions
In conclusion, perioperative continuation of RAS inhibitors in cardiac surgery slightly increases mild, transient AKI but significantly reduces severe AKI and in-hospital mortality. These benefits are most pronounced among patients with severe renal impairment or hypertension, underscoring the need for individualized management rather than routine discontinuation. Prospective trials are warranted to confirm these findings and further guide precision medicine approaches in cardiac surgery.
