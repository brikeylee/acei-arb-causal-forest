Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled **"Preoperative ACEI/ARB Discontinuation Versus Continuation in Cardiac Surgery Patients: A Causal Forest Analysis of Outcomes and Heterogeneous Treatment Effects"** for consideration as an original research article in *eClinicalMedicine*. This work addresses the important clinical question of whether to continue or discontinue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) before cardiac surgery – a topic of ongoing debate due to conflicting guidelines and limited conclusive evidence.

In our study, we analyzed a cohort of 9,430 cardiac surgery patients, which to our knowledge is one of the largest samples investigated on this topic. We applied state-of-the-art causal forest machine learning techniques to estimate **individualized treatment effects (ITEs)**. This advanced approach allowed us to identify how the impact of preoperative ACEI/ARB continuation versus discontinuation differs across various patient subgroups. As a result, our findings provide novel, clinically actionable insights to inform personalized perioperative management of ACEI/ARB therapy, with clear implications for precision medicine in cardiovascular care.

We wish to highlight the following key aspects of our study:

- **Unprecedented sample size:** With 9,430 patients, our analysis is among the largest in this field, providing robust statistical power and broad generalizability.
- **Advanced methodology:** We employed a causal forest algorithm (an innovative machine learning approach for causal inference) to estimate patient-specific treatment effects, enabling a nuanced heterogeneity analysis beyond the capabilities of traditional methods.
- **Individualized, actionable insights:** The results reveal distinct subpopulations of patients who benefit from continuing ACEI/ARB therapy versus those who have better outcomes when the therapy is held. These findings offer actionable guidance to tailor perioperative management for individual patients.
- **Precision medicine impact:** Our heterogeneity-of-treatment-effect analysis and benefit–risk stratification are novel in this context, demonstrating a precision medicine approach to optimize perioperative care. This allows clinicians to balance the risks and benefits of ACEI/ARB continuation on a per-patient basis, moving beyond one-size-fits-all recommendations.

We believe that our manuscript will be of great interest to the readers of *eClinicalMedicine*. It not only addresses a practical management dilemma in perioperative cardiac care but also showcases the integration of big data analytics and machine learning to advance clinical decision-making. By providing evidence-based, personalized recommendations, our study contributes to the ongoing shift toward precision medicine in perioperative practice, aligning well with the journal’s focus on innovative clinical research that improves patient outcomes.

Finally, we affirm that this manuscript is original, has not been previously published, and is not under consideration by any other journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to *eClinicalMedicine*. We have adhered to the highest ethical standards in conducting and reporting our research.

Thank you very much for considering our submission. We appreciate your time and attention, and we hope you will find our study suitable for publication in *eClinicalMedicine*. I am happy to address any questions or provide additional information. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
