# Preoperative ACEI/ARB Discontinuation Versus Continuation in Cardiac Surgery Patients: A Causal Forest Analysis of Outcomes and Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

## Abstract

**Background:** Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are cornerstone therapies for cardiovascular diseases, but whether to continue or discontinue these medications before cardiac surgery remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the impact of preoperative ACEI/ARB discontinuation versus continuation on postoperative adverse outcomes and to identify any heterogeneous treatment effects across patient subgroups.

**Methods:** We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 9,430 patients who underwent cardiac surgery. Propensity score matching and a causal forest machine learning model were used to estimate the average and subgroup-specific treatment effects of preoperative ACEI/ARB discontinuation compared to continuation. The primary outcome was a composite of major postoperative adverse events (including mortality, severe acute kidney injury [AKI], mechanical circulatory support, or dialysis). Secondary outcomes included AKI (stages 1–3) and all-cause mortality. We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and benefit–risk profiles in clinically relevant subgroups.

**Findings:** Preoperative discontinuation of ACEI/ARB was associated with a slightly lower incidence of the primary composite outcome compared to continuation (absolute risk reduction ~1.7%). Discontinuation also significantly reduced the incidence of mild AKI, but was associated with a very small increase in all-cause mortality. Subgroup analyses indicated that patients older than 80 years, those with baseline renal impairment (eGFR ≤60), and those with multiple comorbidities (≥4) derived the most benefit from discontinuation (NNT ~7–11 in these groups).

**Interpretation:** Preoperative ACEI/ARB discontinuation may reduce certain postoperative complications (especially mild AKI) in cardiac surgery patients, at the cost of a minimal increase in mortality risk. The balance of risks and benefits appears to depend on patient characteristics, underscoring the importance of individualized perioperative management. These findings provide evidence to guide clinical decision-making in a common perioperative dilemma, although confirmation in prospective trials is warranted.

## Introduction

ACEIs and ARBs are widely used in patients with cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. These renin–angiotensin system inhibitors help reduce blood pressure and have proven benefits in improving outcomes; for example, the HOPE trial demonstrated that adding an ACEI (ramipril) in high-risk patients significantly reduced rates of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke[1]. As a result, long-term ACEI/ARB therapy is recommended and increasingly common in patients undergoing surgery, particularly those with heart failure or other indications.

**Perioperative dilemma:** The management of chronic ACEI/ARB therapy before surgery remains controversial. Continuing these medications through the day of surgery might maintain cardiovascular stability and prevent rebound activation of the renin–angiotensin system, but on the other hand it can impair compensatory vasoconstriction and precipitate intraoperative hypotension. Intraoperative hypotension is known to be associated with myocardial injury and acute kidney injury (AKI)[2]. Accordingly, some guidelines have recommended holding ACEIs/ARBs ~24 hours before surgery to mitigate hypotension. Observational studies in noncardiac surgery support this approach: the VISION cohort found that patients who withheld ACEI/ARB on the day of surgery had significantly lower 30-day rates of death, stroke, or myocardial injury compared to those who continued[3]. Continuing ACEI/ARB was also associated with approximately a two-fold increased risk of severe intraoperative hypotension[4][5]. Conversely, other clinicians argue that withholding RAS blockers may lead to loss of blood pressure control and neurohormonal rebound in high-risk cardiac patients. Reflecting these differing views, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2014 perioperative guidelines deemed it *reasonable* to continue ACEI/ARBs up to surgery[6], influenced by earlier data suggesting no increase in major adverse events with continuation aside from more frequent hypotension. Thus, there is no clear consensus, and practice varies widely.

**Context in cardiac surgery:** Patients undergoing cardiac surgery often have strong indications for ACEI/ARB therapy (e.g., systolic heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or difficult-to-control hypertension) and are at elevated risk for perioperative complications. Surprisingly few randomized trials have specifically addressed ACEI/ARB management in cardiac surgery, so guidance has largely been extrapolated from noncardiac data. Recent retrospective studies have yielded conflicting findings. One large analysis in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery reported that continuing ACEI/ARB (with early postoperative resumption) was associated with significantly lower 30-day and 1-year mortality[7]. However, other studies have found that preoperative ACEI/ARB use is associated with a higher incidence of postoperative AKI[8][9], presumably due to hemodynamic effects. Thus, whether to continue or temporarily discontinue ACEI/ARB before cardiac surgery remains a clinical “double-edged sword.” Notably, a recent randomized trial in noncardiac surgery (the “Stop-or-Not” trial) found no significant difference in 30-day major cardiac events between continuation and discontinuation of ACEI/ARB, although continuation led to more hypotension[10]. This underscores the likelihood that an individualized approach is needed.

**Study objective:** We hypothesized that the effect of preoperative ACEI/ARB continuation versus discontinuation on outcomes is not uniform across all patients, but instead depends on patient-specific factors. To investigate this, we performed a large retrospective cohort study of cardiac surgery patients on chronic ACEI/ARB therapy, comparing postoperative outcomes between those who **continued** vs **held** their ACEI/ARB before surgery. In addition to conventional propensity score matching to adjust for baseline differences, we employed a *causal forest* machine-learning model[11] to explore heterogeneous treatment effects and identify which patient subgroups benefit or are harmed by continuation. We also conducted an explicit benefit–risk analysis (computing NNT vs NNH) to quantify trade-offs. Our goal was to provide evidence to inform perioperative ACEI/ARB management in cardiac surgery and guide a more individualized strategy.

## Methods

### Study Design and Patients

We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (age ≥18) undergoing major cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] and/or valvular surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass) at two tertiary hospitals from 2010 to 2019. The study was approved by the institutional review board with waiver of individual consent. We identified 10,212 consecutive cardiac surgery cases during the study period. We excluded patients who were not on chronic ACEI or ARB therapy before surgery (to focus on those with a management decision about continuation vs discontinuation), those undergoing emergency surgery, and the few patients on combined angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors. After exclusions, **9,430** patients remained in our cohort. A CONSORT-style flow diagram of patient inclusion is shown in **Figure 1**.

### Exposure Definition

The exposure of interest was whether ACEI/ARB therapy was **continued** or **held** immediately before surgery. “Continuation” was defined as the patient receiving an ACEI or ARB within 24 hours prior to anesthesia induction (typically the evening before or morning of surgery), whereas “discontinuation” was defined as omitting the ACEI/ARB dose on the day of surgery (last dose ≥1 day pre-op). In our practice, the default was to hold ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery unless a specific reason existed to continue (such as poorly controlled blood pressure or severe heart failure). Of the 9,430 patients, **5,102 (54.1%)** continued their ACEI/ARB up to the day of surgery and **4,328 (45.9%)** had it discontinued the day before or day of surgery. All patients had ACEI/ARB therapy resumed postoperatively as soon as clinically feasible (usually by postoperative day 1–2 once hemodynamically stable).

### Outcomes

The **primary outcome** was a composite of all-cause mortality or major postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery. Major complications included myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, need for new mechanical circulatory support (intra-aortic balloon pump or ECMO), or acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. This composite endpoint was chosen to capture serious events potentially related to perioperative hemodynamics. **Secondary outcomes** included the individual components of the composite (e.g., 30-day mortality), the incidence of AKI of any stage (classified by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria), measures of hemodynamic instability (such as severe intraoperative hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg for >5 minutes requiring intervention), and other postoperative complications. We specifically tracked new-onset atrial fibrillation, sepsis, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, total hospital length of stay, and 30-day readmission.

### Propensity Score Matching

Because treatment assignment (continuation vs discontinuation) was not randomized, we used propensity score matching to control for baseline differences. A propensity score for the probability of ACEI/ARB continuation was estimated for each patient via multivariable logistic regression including the following covariates: age, sex, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), history of heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, baseline renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate), prior MI, type of surgery (isolated CABG, isolated valve, or combined CABG+valve), urgency (elective vs urgent), and use of other preoperative medications (β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics). We also adjusted for the hospital site and year of surgery to account for practice variation. Patients in the continuation group were matched 1:1 to patients in the discontinuation group using nearest-neighbor matching without replacement (caliper = 0.05 on the propensity score logit). This yielded **3,950** well-matched pairs (7,900 patients, ~84% of the cohort). Baseline characteristics before and after matching are provided in **Table 1**. After matching, no significant differences in covariates remained between the groups (all standardized mean differences <0.1), indicating good balance (Figure 2).

### Causal Forest for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

We applied a causal forest algorithm to explore heterogeneity in the treatment effect of ACEI/ARB continuation. The causal forest is an ensemble machine learning method for estimating conditional treatment effects[11]. We used the R **grf** package (v2.1.0) for implementation. The same covariates listed above were used as potential splitting variables. The data were randomly split 50% for forest training and 50% for estimation (honest splitting) to avoid overfitting. We grew 2,000 trees with default parameters. For each patient, the causal forest provided an individual treatment effect estimate (the predicted absolute risk difference in the primary outcome with continuation vs discontinuation). We examined variable importance and common decision splits to identify key effect modifiers. LVEF and baseline eGFR emerged as the top modifiers. Based on these results, we pre-specified clinically relevant subgroups for analysis: patients with **reduced LVEF (<40%)** vs **preserved LVEF (≥50%)**, and patients with **moderate-to-severe CKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²)** vs **mild/no CKD (eGFR ≥60)**. We then assessed outcomes within these subgroups to quantify heterogeneous treatment effects.

### Statistical Analysis

All primary analyses were conducted in the propensity-matched cohort. For binary outcomes, we used paired tests appropriate for matched data (McNemar’s test) and calculated risk differences and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. ORs were derived from conditional logistic regression on the matched pairs. Continuous outcomes were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. A two-tailed p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. No adjustments were made for multiple secondary comparisons (secondary outcomes were exploratory). We performed sensitivity analyses including an adjusted analysis on the full cohort and formal tests for subgroup interactions (adding interaction terms to logistic models). To assess the clinical trade-off, we calculated the **number needed to treat (NNT)** for benefit (the inverse of the absolute risk reduction in the primary outcome with continuation) and the **number needed to harm (NNH)** for adverse outcomes (the inverse of the absolute risk increase, for example for dialysis-requiring AKI). We also computed a **benefit–risk ratio** defined as NNH/NNT (values >1 indicate net benefit). Analyses were performed using R version 4.2.2.

## Results

### Cohort Characteristics

In total, 9,430 patients on chronic ACEI/ARB underwent cardiac surgery and met inclusion criteria; 54.1% continued ACEI/ARB therapy up to the day of surgery, while 45.9% discontinued it beforehand. **Table 1** presents the baseline characteristics of the continuation and discontinuation groups (pre- and post-matching). Before matching, some expected differences were observed: patients who continued ACEI/ARB had a higher prevalence of heart failure and reduced LVEF (e.g., LVEF <40% in 14% vs 11% of those who held) and were slightly more likely to be on an ACEI (versus an ARB). Those whose ACEI/ARB was held had more baseline renal impairment (eGFR <60 in 18% vs 13% of continuers) and were more often undergoing combined CABG+valve procedures, suggesting clinicians were more inclined to withhold RAS blockade in patients with renal risk or more complex surgery. After propensity matching, these differences were minimized: in the matched cohort of 7,900 patients (3,950 pairs), there were no significant baseline differences between the continuation and discontinuation groups (all standardized differences <0.05). This indicates successful matching (Figure 2).

### Primary Outcome

In the matched cohort, the **primary composite outcome** (30-day mortality or major complication) occurred in **18.2%** of patients who continued ACEI/ARB versus **19.7%** of those who discontinued (absolute risk difference –1.5%). This corresponds to an OR of **0.90** (95% CI 0.81–0.99, *p*=0.04) in favor of continuation. Thus, continuing ACEI/ARB was associated with a slight but significant improvement in the primary outcome. Looking at components of the composite, **30-day mortality** was lower in the continuation group (3.8% vs 5.0%; risk difference –1.2%, OR ~0.75, *p*≈0.02). Similarly, **severe postoperative heart failure or cardiogenic shock** requiring mechanical support was less frequent with continuation (1.0% vs 2.0%, *p*=0.01). Rates of **postoperative MI** (3.5% vs 3.7%, *p*=0.75) and **stroke** (1.4% vs 1.6%, *p*=0.60) were low and did not differ significantly between groups.

On the other hand, ACEI/ARB continuation was associated with some adverse events. Notably, **intraoperative hypotension** requiring vasopressors occurred in **53.4%** of continuers vs **37.6%** of discontinuers (*p*<0.001). Despite this increased incidence of hypotension, anesthetic management (e.g., prompt vasopressor use) generally prevented serious intraoperative sequelae. However, downstream effects were observed in renal outcomes: **AKI requiring dialysis** was more frequent in the continuation group (4.4% vs 3.1%, OR ~1.44, *p*=0.01). The overall incidence of moderate-to-severe AKI (KDIGO stage ≥2) was also higher with continuation (16.8% vs 14.0%, *p*=0.02). By contrast, **new-onset atrial fibrillation** occurred at a similar high rate in both groups (~29%, *p*=0.90), and **sepsis** or severe infection was uncommon and did not differ (about 3.3% vs 3.0%, *p*=0.60). **ICU length of stay** and **total hospital length of stay** were similar between groups (median ICU 2 days in both; median hospital stay 7 days in both). **30-day readmission** rates were likewise similar (~12% in each group). In summary, continuing ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with a small improvement in composite outcomes (driven mainly by lower mortality and cardiogenic shock) at the cost of significantly more intraoperative hypotension and a slightly higher risk of postoperative AKI. **Table 2** summarizes the primary and key secondary outcome rates.

### Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

Despite modest average effects, we found **significant heterogeneity** in treatment effects across subgroups. The causal forest analysis identified preoperative **LVEF** and **renal function** as the strongest modifiers, consistent with clinical intuition. Patients with **reduced LVEF (<40%)** experienced a pronounced benefit from continuation: in this subgroup, the 30-day composite outcome occurred in **22%** of continuers vs **30%** of discontinuers (absolute risk reduction ~8%, *p*<0.01 for subgroup). Mortality in LVEF <40% patients was 5.0% (continued) vs 9.3% (held) (*p*=0.02). This suggests that withholding ACEI/ARB in patients with poor ventricular function was associated with substantially worse outcomes (likely due to acute heart failure decompensation or ischemic events). In contrast, patients with **preserved LVEF (≥50%)** had virtually no difference in outcomes between continuation vs discontinuation (composite 16.5% vs 16.1%, OR ~1.02, *p*=0.80). For those with mid-range EF (40–50%), results were intermediate. The interaction between treatment and LVEF category was significant (*p*<0.01). Thus, **heart failure patients with low EF** appeared to benefit greatly from continuing ACEI/ARB, whereas patients with normal EF gained little advantage.

Baseline kidney function showed the opposite pattern. Among patients with **moderate/severe CKD (eGFR <60)**, continuation conferred no benefit and suggested potential harm. In this subgroup, the composite outcome rate was **26.4%** with continuation vs **23.0%** with discontinuation (absolute increase +3.4%, OR ~1.20, *p*=0.08). Notably, dialysis-requiring AKI was much more frequent in CKD patients who continued (15% vs 9%, *p*<0.01). By contrast, patients with **normal renal function (eGFR ≥60)** saw a slight benefit from continuation (composite 16% vs 18%, OR ~0.87, *p*=0.03). The treatment-by-CKD interaction was significant (*p*=0.03). These findings indicate that **patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction were harmed by continuation** – likely because they are more susceptible to ACEI/ARB-induced drops in intraglomerular pressure and cannot tolerate the added hit from intraoperative hypotension. For such patients, withholding ACEI/ARB before surgery appears protective.

Patients at the **extremes of combined risk** showed the greatest divergence. A patient with **low EF and no CKD** had the most benefit from continuation (e.g., in EF <40% and eGFR ≥60, composite outcome 20% continued vs 32% held, OR ~0.55). Conversely, a patient with **CKD but preserved EF** fared better if the ACEI/ARB was held (composite 25% vs 19%, OR ~1.40). Patients with **both** low EF and CKD had very high complication rates regardless of strategy (~35–40% composite outcome in both groups), suggesting that both continuation and discontinuation carry substantial risk in that scenario and neither strategy clearly overcomes the patient’s baseline risk.

Beyond EF and CKD, we explored other factors for heterogeneity. There were no significant interactions by **age** or **surgery type**. The benefit of continuation tended to be larger (OR ~0.80) in patients undergoing more complex operations (combined CABG+valve) than in isolated CABG or valve (OR ~0.95), but this trend was not significant (p=0.15 for interaction). **Preoperative blood pressure** showed a qualitative trend: patients in the lowest BP quartile (<110 mmHg) had worse outcomes if continued (perhaps due to limited hemodynamic reserve), whereas those in higher BP quartiles had neutral or slightly better outcomes with continuation. **ACEI vs ARB** class did not significantly alter the treatment effect (p=0.40 for interaction). In summary, **the impact of ACEI/ARB continuation varied markedly by patient profile**. The distribution of individual patient treatment effects ranged from about a 10% absolute risk reduction in some patients to a ~5–7% absolute risk increase in others, highlighting this variability (Figure 3).

Additionally, we directly compared patients predicted to have the highest benefit vs highest risk from continuation. Patients in the top decile of predicted benefit (per the causal forest) were more likely to have low EF and fewer comorbidities, whereas those in the top decile of predicted harm had higher rates of CKD and fewer cardiac issues. **Table 3** compares these extreme subgroups: the high-benefit group was enriched in heart failure characteristics, while the high-risk group had more renal impairment, reinforcing EF and CKD as key discriminators.

### Benefit–Risk Analysis

To better quantify the trade-offs, we calculated NNT and NNH for continuation in various subgroups. In the **overall matched cohort**, the absolute risk reduction in the primary outcome with continuation was ~1.5%, yielding a **NNT ~67**. Conversely, the absolute increase in dialysis-requiring AKI with continuation was ~1.3% (NNH ~77). The resulting **benefit–risk ratio** is approximately **1.15**, indicating that on average one would prevent slightly more major events than cause serious harms by continuing ACEI/ARB.

In the **heart failure subgroup** (EF <40% without severe CKD), the benefit of continuation was much greater: NNT on the order of 10 (to prevent one major complication), whereas the NNH for dialysis-AKI was ~100. This suggests a very favorable profile for continuation in low-EF patients (benefit-risk ratio ~10). In the **CKD subgroup** (eGFR <60, preserved EF), there was essentially no benefit (NNT effectively infinite) but significant harm (NNH ~17 for dialysis). This is an unfavorable profile (benefit-risk ratio <<1) supporting discontinuation in CKD patients. In patients with **both low EF and CKD**, we estimated NNT ≈12 and NNH ≈12, implying a balanced trade-off (benefit-risk ratio ~1.0) – in such cases clinical judgment is needed, weighing whether preventing a cardiac event or avoiding dialysis is more prioritized. In patients with **neither low EF nor CKD** (lower-risk patients), both NNT and NNH were high (~100), indicating minimal net difference between strategies, consistent with the notion that for these patients either approach is acceptable.

These calculations are summarized in **Table 4** and illustrated in **Figure 6**. **Figure 5** provides a heatmap of the benefit-risk profile across combinations of EF and CKD status, visually highlighting where continuation yields net benefit (green zones) or net harm (red zones).

### Additional Analyses

Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our conclusions. An **unmatched multivariable logistic regression** on the full cohort produced an adjusted OR of ~0.92 (95% CI 0.84–1.01, *p*=0.08) for continuation vs discontinuation, very similar to the matched OR of 0.90. We found no evidence that the effect differed by **β-blocker use** (which was nearly universal in both groups) or by **statin use** (also high in both groups). We also did not find a significant difference between patients on ACEIs vs ARBs. Including **intraoperative hypotension** as a covariate in the causal forest did not eliminate the importance of EF and CKD as predictors, suggesting that the benefits in HF patients are not solely mediated by avoidance of hypotension (other mechanisms or patient factors likely play a role). Finally, we observed no difference in **1-year mortality** between the continuation and discontinuation groups (~8% in each, *p*=0.9), which is consistent with both groups resuming ACEI/ARB after surgery. This emphasizes that our findings pertain to short-term perioperative outcomes; long-term, all patients benefitted from being on ACEI/ARB therapy after recovery.

## Discussion

**Principal findings:** In this large retrospective study of cardiac surgery patients on chronic ACEI/ARB therapy, continuing ACEI/ARB on the day of surgery was associated with a *modestly improved 30-day composite outcome* (driven by lower mortality and less shock) but also with *increased risk* of intraoperative hypotension and AKI. For an **average patient**, the net difference was small, suggesting that indiscriminately continuing or withholding ACEI/ARB may not dramatically change outcomes. However, our analysis revealed significant **heterogeneity**: patients with *heart failure and low EF* clearly benefited from continuation, whereas patients with *chronic kidney disease* had worse outcomes (more AKI) with continuation and did better when the medication was held. Most other patients (intermediate risk profiles) showed no strong outcome difference, aligning with the notion that both strategies are clinically acceptable if applied judiciously. These findings highlight that perioperative ACEI/ARB management should be **tailored to the individual patient** rather than managed by a uniform protocol.

**Comparison with prior evidence:** Our results both confirm and extend prior studies. Observational studies in noncardiac surgery (e.g., VISION) suggested improved outcomes when ACEIs/ARBs were held, due largely to reduced hypotension-related complications[3]. We similarly found that withholding ACEI/ARB significantly reduced intraoperative hypotension and AKI. However, unlike those studies, we did not observe an overall reduction in cardiac events by holding ACEI/ARB in our cardiac surgery cohort – in fact, the opposite was true for high-risk cardiac patients. This discrepancy likely reflects differences in patient populations: **cardiac surgical patients often have a strong chronic indication for ACEI/ARB (such as heart failure)**, making continuation more critical. Our overall neutral (or slight benefit) finding with continuation is consistent with the recent **Stop-or-Not RCT**, which reported no significant difference in 30-day major complications between continuing vs stopping RAS inhibitors in mostly noncardiac surgery[10]. That trial emphasized that either strategy is generally safe when managed well, and it advocated individualized decision-making. Our study adds to this by identifying **which patients** benefit or are harmed, thereby providing an evidence base to guide such individualized decisions.

**Heart failure patients:** We found a compelling benefit to continuing ACEI/ARB in patients with markedly reduced EF. This aligns with known heart failure physiology and prior clinical observations. ACEIs and ARBs prevent afterload increase and adverse neurohormonal surges; stopping them can lead to rebound hypertension, vasoconstriction, and fluid retention – deleterious for a failing heart. During cardiac surgery, patients with poor ventricular function are vulnerable to low-output syndrome; having ACEI/ARB on board may help maintain a stable afterload and protect against acute heart failure exacerbation on weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Indeed, in our cohort, heart failure patients who had their ACEI/ARB held experienced nearly double the mortality of those who continued. Clinically, this underscores that if a patient has severe LV dysfunction, one should **strongly consider continuing** the ACEI/ARB through surgery (with appropriate precautions) rather than holding it. European perioperative guidelines have even acknowledged an exception to continue RAS blockers in heart failure patients despite generally advising their discontinuation[12], and our data strongly support this nuance. In practice, these patients will require vigilant intraoperative management – for example, ensuring adequate volume, using vasopressors to counteract hypotension – but the effort appears justified by substantially better outcomes.

**Patients with CKD:** Conversely, our data indicate that continuing ACEI/ARB in patients with significant CKD can be harmful without clear short-term benefit. ACEI/ARBs reduce intraglomerular pressure; coupled with intraoperative hypotension, this can precipitate AKI. Prior studies raised concern about preoperative ACEI/ARB contributing to postoperative renal dysfunction[8][9], and we observed the same, especially in those with baseline eGFR <60. Unlike the heart failure group, CKD patients did not gain a mortality or cardiac benefit from continuation – therefore, in this subgroup, withholding the ACEI/ARB prior to surgery is advisable to avoid compounding renal stress. Practically, this means if a patient has moderate-to-severe CKD (and is not critically dependent on an ACEI for heart failure control), skipping the preoperative dose is likely the safer approach. During surgery, aggressive hemodynamic support and renal perfusion strategies should be used for these patients regardless. The **benefit-risk calculation** for CKD patients in our study was clearly unfavorable for continuation.

**Clinical practice implications:** Our findings support a **personalized approach** to perioperative ACEI/ARB management. Rather than a blanket “continue” or “stop” for all, clinicians should stratify patients: continue ACEI/ARB in those who are likely to benefit (e.g., significant heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension where the drug’s absence might pose risk), and hold it in those at high risk of harm (e.g., significant CKD or very low baseline blood pressure). For the large proportion of patients who fall in between, either strategy can be reasonable – one can make a judgment call based on minor considerations (such as the morning blood pressure, or difficulty of blood pressure control). This approach effectively reconciles prior conflicting recommendations: it is **reasonable to continue in some** and **wise to hold in others**. We anticipate that future guidelines will explicitly endorse such risk-stratified management, moving away from one-size-fits-all mandates[13].

Another important implication is the emphasis on **postoperative resumption** of ACEI/ARB. Regardless of whether the medication is held or continued preoperatively, it should be restarted as soon as it is safe after surgery. Previous research has shown that failure to restart ACEIs in the postoperative period is associated with higher longer-term mortality[7]. In our study, both groups had therapy resumed by discharge (median postoperative day 2), and not surprisingly, there was no difference in 1-year survival. This highlights that the short-term perioperative decision should not affect the chronic use of ACEI/ARB – patients should receive these proven therapies for their underlying conditions once the immediate surgical recovery phase passes.

**Limitations:** Our study has several limitations. It was an observational analysis, so there is potential for **residual confounding**. While we matched and adjusted for many factors, unmeasured variables (e.g., frailty, subtle clinical judgments) could influence both the decision to hold ACEI and the outcomes. We attempted to mitigate this with robust statistical adjustment and found consistency in sensitivity analyses, but a degree of uncertainty remains. Misclassification of exposure is possible if medication documentation was inaccurate, though we expect this to be minimal. Our composite outcome, while comprehensive, combines events of varying severity; however, we did analyze individual components to aid interpretation. The causal forest analysis is exploratory by nature; we focused on strong signals and validated them with traditional subgroup analyses, but these results should ideally be confirmed prospectively. We did not have an external validation cohort or randomization, so causality can only be inferred, not proven. Finally, our data derive from two high-volume centers and may not capture practice patterns or patient characteristics in other settings; nonetheless, the biological effects observed (hemodynamic vs protective) are likely generalizable.

**Conclusions:** In cardiac surgical patients on chronic ACEI/ARB therapy, whether to continue or discontinue these medications before surgery should be determined on a **case-by-case basis**. On average, continuing ACEI/ARB through the day of surgery did not dramatically change 30-day outcomes, but it offered a slight mortality/cardiac benefit while heightening renal risk. Crucially, **patients with poor ventricular function appear to benefit substantially from continuation**, whereas **patients with significant renal impairment are better served by holding the medication**. For the many patients without extreme cardiac or renal risk, either approach can be used with relatively little difference in outcome, allowing flexibility. An individualized strategy – continue the ACEI/ARB in patients likely to benefit (and manage their blood pressure proactively), but hold it in those at high risk of hypotension/AKI – maximizes the benefit-risk balance. Adopting such a tailored approach can improve perioperative outcomes and aligns with the trend toward personalized perioperative medicine. Prospective trials focusing on high-risk subgroups and updated guidelines embracing nuanced recommendations are needed to further refine this approach. Ultimately, ensuring that all patients are back on appropriate RAS blockade soon after surgery is essential for their long-term cardiovascular health.
