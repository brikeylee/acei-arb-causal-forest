Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled **"Individual-Level Treatment Effect Estimation for Perioperative ACEI/ARB Management in Cardiac Surgery: A Causal Forest Analysis"** for consideration for publication in *Annals of Intensive Care*.

Recent multicenter evidence has established that, on average, perioperative continuation of ACEI/ARB reduces severe adverse events after cardiac surgery. However, average treatment effects offer limited guidance for individual clinical decisions. Our study addresses this gap by applying causal forest analysis—a machine learning method specifically designed for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation—to generate patient-level estimates of treatment benefit.

**Our study makes three distinct contributions beyond existing evidence:**

1. **From population averages to individual estimates.** We demonstrate that individual treatment effects span a clinically meaningful range: from negligible benefit in young patients (NNT>200) to substantial benefit in elderly patients with impaired renal function (NNT~29). This 2.5-fold gradient across the age spectrum, and the continuous inverse relationship with eGFR, provides granularity that binary subgroup analyses cannot capture.

2. **Universal but graded benefit.** The causal forest calibration test reveals that the protective effect of continuation is universal in direction (97.4% of patients benefit) but graded in magnitude—a "broadly beneficial" pattern that simplifies clinical decision-making while allowing individualized benefit communication.

3. **Methodological cross-validation.** Three distinct analytical approaches (propensity score matching, inverse probability weighting, and causal forest) yield concordant average treatment effects, and causal forest subgroup estimates show 100% directional concordance with traditional logistic regression across 11 subgroups, providing strong mutual validation.

This work complements a companion multicenter study by our group (currently under consideration at *Critical Care*) that established population-level severity-stratified AKI outcomes using traditional epidemiological methods. The present study extends those findings to the individual patient level using a distinct analytical framework, representing independent scientific contributions.

This manuscript has not been published previously and is not under consideration for publication as a research article elsewhere. All authors have approved the submitted version.

We look forward to your consideration.
